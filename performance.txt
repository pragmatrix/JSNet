JavaScript Parser Performance

Files, Milliseconds

			support for empty function bodies, removed files where implicit
			semicolon insertion is required
44	155267
			reordered keyword detection:
			"this" had a higher prio than Identifier
			"new" had a higher prio than Identifier
			"function" had a higher prio than Identifier

81	159906
			fixed a "function" -> Identifier conflict
83	149945	
			relaxed parsing of Decimals (allow 000 for example to be valid)
84  152088
----------  milestone reached: all files except auto-semicolon insertion and
			regular expressions can be parseed
----------  simplification of core algorithm
84	148619
			avoid emptying processing stack if FailAllRules cannot be resolved
			for a production.
84	150305 
			Implemented cache for left recursion states.
84	138534	
			Reenabled a Conditional("TRACE").
84	17916		
			Simple tests for FailAllRules
84	17761	
			Used state stack instead of processing command stack
84  14787
			Minor optimization on nullable values.
84  14177
			Don't push stuff on the processing stack if it is not required.
84	13704
			Replaced direct left recursions by any (*)
